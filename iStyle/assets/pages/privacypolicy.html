      1. Limitation of Liability
    </h2>
    <p>
      The contents of this website are created with utmost care. However, the provider assumes no responsibility for
      the
      accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content provided. The use of the contents of the website is at the
      user's own risk. Contributions marked by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the
      opinion of the provider. With the pure use of the website of the provider comes no contractual relationship
      between
      the user and the provider.

    <h2>

      2. External links
    </h2>
    <p>

      This website contains links to third party websites ("external links"). These websites are the responsibility of
      the respective operators. The provider has checked the third-party content when first linking external links to
      determine whether any legal violations exist. At that time, no violations were evident. The provider has no
      influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The setting of external links does
      not
      mean that the provider accepts the content behind the reference or link. A constant control of external links is
      not reasonable for the provider without concrete evidence of legal violations. With knowledge of legal offenses
      however such external links are deleted immediately.
    </p>
    <h2>

      3. Copyright and ancillary copyright
    </h2>
    <p>

      The content published on this website is subject to German copyright and ancillary copyright. Any use not
      permitted
      by German copyright and ancillary copyright law requires the prior written consent of the provider or respective
      copyright holder. This applies in particular to duplication, processing, translation, storage, processing or
      reproduction of content in databases or other electronic media and systems. Contents and rights of third parties
      are marked as such. The unauthorized duplication or passing on of individual contents or complete sides is not
      permitted and punishable. Only the production of copies and downloads for personal, private and non-commercial
      use
      is permitted.

      The presentation of this website in external frames is only permitted with written permission.

    <h2>

      4. Privacy
    </h2>
    <p>


      By visiting the website of the provider information about the access (date, time, page viewed) can be saved.
      These
      data do not belong to the personal data, but are anonymized. They are evaluated for statistical purposes only. A
      transfer to third parties, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, does not take place.

      The provider expressly points out that data transmission on the Internet (eg in the case of communication by
      e-mail) has security gaps and can not be completely protected against access by third parties.

      The use of the contact details of the imprint for commercial advertising is expressly not desired, unless the
      provider had previously given his written consent or there is already a business relationship. The provider and
      all
      persons named on this website hereby object to any commercial use and disclosure of their data.

      5. Special Terms of Use

      Insofar as special conditions for individual uses of this website deviate from the aforementioned numbers 1 to 4,
      this is expressly stated at the appropriate place. In this case, the special conditions of use apply in each
      individual case.
